			<h2> INFSCI 2560: Web Technologies and Standards</h2>
			<h3>Fall 2018</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<p class="text-justify">This course is about the various technologies that we use to build Web
			applications. It is focused on preparing you for a full stack web development
			position. The main approach for this class is a hands-on experience that will
			allow you to build a complete web application from scratch. The course will
			introduce client and server-side technologies for the web. This will include a set
			of front-end technologies HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, responsive design etc. and
			A set of back-end technologies (JSP, Servlets, Node.js, Socket io). In general,
			we will integrate different technologies including some of the most popular
			frameworks depending on the project we are working on. Each week will consist
			of a lecture that will cover new concepts and different topics and will also
			integrates standards and best practices, you will then be presented with a realworld problem related to the topic discussed in the lecture, you will work in
			groups to solve it. If a problem is not applicable to the topic being discussed,
			you will be given a tutorial to build a web component that you will work in
			developing in class or the rest of the class will be dedicated to open discussions.
			This problem-based learning approach is more suitable for a real-world
			environment. It is what you will work in so it is important to work as a team and
			communicate with your group members regularly. It is also essential to do your
			reading before the class.</p>
